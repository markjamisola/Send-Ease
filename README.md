# **IT120-SMS Application (send ease)**

## **Overview**

- The IT120-SMS Application is a Django-based web application designed for sending SMS messages. The application integrates with Twilio, a cloud communications platform, to send messages from a Twilio phone number to the recipient's mobile phone number.

- This system allows users to input their phone number, select a salutation (greeting), enter the recipient's name, compose a custom message, and send it via SMS. The app ensures seamless communication between the sender and the recipient.

## **Features**

- **Salutation (Greeting):** Choose from predefined salutations (e.g., "Good Morning", "Hello") to personalize messages.

- **Recipient Name:** Add the recipient's name, and the system will send the message with the greeting followed by the recipient’s name.

- **Twilio Integration:** Utilizes Twilio’s API for seamless message sending.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple web interface to send SMS messages with form validation.

- **Error Handling:** Handles errors and displays them to the user if any issues arise during message sending.
